 Consider asking for an increase in your salary. While needing more money is a great motivator, don't use this as a reason to ask for a raise. Instead, focus on some of the positive contributions you've made to the company and/or the workplace, such as:

    Exceeding expectations
    Taken on new responsibilities
    Boosted team morale

Be sure to bring supporting documents, such as reviews, emails from colleagues and stakeholders, and reports that measure your success. In addition to identifying your value, provide market research about salaries for similar jobs to justify your request for a pay increase.
